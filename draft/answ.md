Part 2
What are the "Four Freedoms" defined by the Free Software Foundation?
Fredoom 0-The freedom to use the software: the software can be run for any purpose.

Freedom 1-The freedom to study the software and modify it to suit your needThe source
code of the software must be accessible so that users can examine it, understand it, 
and modify it to meet their needs.

Freedom 2-The freedom to redistribute copies: Users have the freedom to distribute 
copies of the software, either for free or for a fee, to help others.

Freedom 3-The freedom to improve the software and share those improvements with the community:
Users can modify the software and share their improvements with the community so that others can
benefit from them. To do so, the source code must be available.

How does the GNU Manifesto justify the ethical importance of free software?
The GNU Manifesto justifies the ethical importance of free software by arguing
that control over software should lie with the users, not corporations. According 
to the manifesto, proprietary software restricts users' freedoms, treating them as
subjects of control, while free software promotes cooperation, access to knowledge,
and respect for individual autonomy and rights.

What is the difference between "open source" and "free software"?
Free software focuses on user freedoms (use, modify, share), while open source emphasizes 
practical access to source code for collaboration. All free software is open source, but not 
all open source is free software.
